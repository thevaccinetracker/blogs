# Welcome to The Vaccine Tracker

Researchers around the world are developing [more than 140 vaccines](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines) against the coronavirus. Vaccines typically require years of research and testing before reaching the clinic, but scientists are racing to produce a [safe and effective vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/20/science/coronavirus-vaccine-development.html) by next year. Researchers worldwide are working around the clock to find a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts estimate that a fast-tracked vaccine development process could speed a successful candidate to market in approximately 12-18 months – if the process goes smoothly from conception to market availability.

This tracker lists COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in Phase 1-3 trials, as well as major candidates in pre-clinical stages of development and research. Information will be updated weekly.

## Status Update

Here’s a guide to some of the most talked-about efforts to treat or prevent coronavirus infection, with details on the science, history, and timeline for each endeavor (and we will update the tracker with any new developments). We’re looking at novel medicines, not repurposed drugs. (For more on some of the efforts to repurpose drugs, read [this](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/18/who-to-launch-multinational-trial-to-jumpstart-search-for-coronavirus-drugs/). The below therapies and vaccines are sorted in order of how close they could be to approval, starting with a treatment in Phase 3 trials, followed by others in Phase 1 studies and then preclinical development. Approval, of course, would only come if they are proven safe and effective.

For an overview of the vaccine pipeline, please see the WHO Global R&D Observatory [here](http://www.who.int/research-observatory/monitoring/processes/health_products/en/).

We make an effort to update the trial list and results reporting on a regular basis. Below please find the most recent updates for each page:
